## 3. üîë Local SSL Development Environment

Running the local server in `https` is required to consume Meta's (Facebook's) Marketing API that enforces the app be served via `https`. Use the following instructions to create local SSL certificates and modify your host file for local development using SSL.

### 3.1. Install `mkcert`

[mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) is a simple tool for making locally-trusted development certificates. It requires no configuration.

#### 3.1.1. macOs

**On macOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)**

```sh
brew install mkcert
brew install nss # if you use Firefox
```

#### 3.1.2. Windows

**On Windows, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)**

```
choco install mkcert
```

**or use Scoop**

```
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install mkcert
```

or build from source (requires Go 1.10+), or use [the pre-built binaries](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases).

If you're running into permission problems try running `mkcert` as an Administrator.

### 3.2. Generate Certificates

**Create local Certificate Authority**

```sh
mkcert -install
# > Created a new local CA üí•
# > The local CA is now installed in the system trust store! ‚ö°Ô∏è
# > The local CA is now installed in the Firefox trust store (requires browser restart)! ü¶ä
```

**In case of the following (Windows) follow this [workaround](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/issues/231#issuecomment-695776701)**

```
# > Error cert: Failed adding cert: Access is denied.
```

**Create `cert` directory at root level of project**

```sh
mkdir cert
```

**Make adpuzl certificates**

```sh
mkcert -key-file ./cert/adpuzl.local-key.pem -cert-file ./cert/adpuzl.local.pem adpuzl.local "*.adpuzl.local" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1

# > Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
# >  - "adpuzl.local"
# >  - "*.adpuzl.local"
# >  - "localhost"
# >  - "127.0.0.1"
# >  - "::1"

# > The certificate is at "./cert/adpuzl.local.pem" and the key at "./cert/adpuzl.local-key.pem" ‚úÖ
```

### 3.3. Modify Hosts File

Add an `adpuzl.local` entry into your hosts file to redirect your browser to the local dev server. Learn more about [how hosts file works](https://pressidium.com/blog/the-hosts-file-a-powerful-tool-for-users-and-developers/). **Recommended**: make a backup of your hosts file before modifying.

1. Locate the hosts file for your OS, see below
2. Open file in a text editor
3. Add the following to the hosts file:

```
# AdPuzl dev server redirect
127.0.0.1  adpuzl.local
```

> macOS hosts file location:
>
> `/etc/hosts`

> Windows hosts file location:
>
> `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc`

## 4. ü§´ Environment Variables

Copy the file `.env-example` and rename to `.env.local`

```sh
cp .env-example .env.local
```

## 5. üî† Font Awesome Local Dev Environment Variable

#### 5.1 MacOS/Linux

[Font Awesome Pro](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-web/setup/using-package-managers) uses the `.npmrc` file to register the Pro license. This file does not read variables from .env but the environment variables on the local machine. To include the token in the build process, add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file in your home directory.

```bash
export FONTAWESOME_TOKEN=00000-0000-0000-0000-0000000
```

#### 5.2 Windows

[Add a local environment variable](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/machine-learning/oml4r/1.5.1/oread/creating-and-modifying-environment-variables-on-windows.html#GUID-DD6F9982-60D5-48F6-8270-A27EC53807D0) to windows with

```
variable name: FONTAWESOME_TOKEN
variable value: 00000-0000-0000-0000-0000000
```

You will need to replace the placeholder token with the actual token. This can be found under _Environment Variables_ in the Site Settings for the web service provider. Save the config file and restart your terminal.
